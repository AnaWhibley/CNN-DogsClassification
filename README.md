# CNN-DogsClassification
Development of a Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of dog breeds. 

The different races that red will identify and classify are:
* Corgi
* Well-built
* Pug
* Dachshund (dachshund)

The red neuronal needs to learn to recognize a diversity of objects (in this case dogs) within the images and for this it needs a large number of images so that the red one can capture the unique characteristics of each object and in turn, be able to generalize it. You can find the data set that I will use in the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishvns/dogclassification).
